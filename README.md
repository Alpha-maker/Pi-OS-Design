# pi-OS
2017 Spring UMD ENEE447 Operating System Lab

The lab session will ask students to implement Pi-OS for Raspberry Pi 3B. There're 6 lab projects, 
1) Scheduling system
2) Interrupt, timer, and advanced scheduling
3) System call
4) File system
5) Processes & Multi-threading
6) Inter-process communication

The original source code is adapted from circle(https://github.com/rsta2/circle), another open source software for Pi platform. Some OS concepts or design ideas in pi-OS are borrowed from Linux, but simplified. Course TAs create all the projects for this lab.
